This machine learning project builds for a real estate price prediction in website. 
We will first build a model using sklearn and Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost Regression using banglore home prices dataset. 
Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. 
Third component is the website that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and 
it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 
During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, 
outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, randomsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, 
k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn and XGBoost for model building
5. Jupyter notebook and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
